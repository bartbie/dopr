Simple Rust + htmx TODO app using postgres as persistence layer

To run this docker-compose use `docker compose up` (Use `-d` for detached mode and `--build` if you need to build it first/again).

Docker should host the docker-compose network at localhost.
http://localhost:3000

`docker compose down` to gracefully shutdown the app (& db).
